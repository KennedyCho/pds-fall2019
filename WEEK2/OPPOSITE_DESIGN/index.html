<!-- Opposite Design: Make a black and white
design with two procedural shapes which represents
opposite things. For example, the first shape should
be a design of the word wet while the other should be
a design of the word sharp. Highly recommend that you
design the "wet and sharp" but you still can choose any
other pair of Opposite Words. -->

<!-- use a for-loop, beginShape(), and bezierVertex() in your code -->
